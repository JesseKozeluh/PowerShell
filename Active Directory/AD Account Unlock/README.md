## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1+

## Installation Instructions

To delegate unlock permissions to a non-domain admin user:

1. **Install RSAT** on the client machine:  
   Download and install `WindowsTH-KB2693643-x64.msu` for Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)

2. **Open Active Directory Users and Computers**

3. Navigate to the organizational unit (OU) â€” e.g., `Users`

4. **Right-click the OU**, then select `Delegate Control...`

5. Add the required user and click **Next**

6. Select `Create a custom task to delegate` and click **Next**

7. Choose `Only the following objects in the folder`  
   - Tick `User objects`, then click **Next**

8. Select `Property-specific`  
   - Tick **Read lockoutTime** and **Write lockoutTime**, then click **Next** to confirm

This ensures the user can query and modify lockout status without full admin rights.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a PowerShell session with AD access
2. A GUI window will open showing currently locked-out accounts
3. Select one or more accounts from the list
4. Click **Unlock** to unlock all selected accounts
5. Click **Refresh** to re-scan for new lockouts
6. Click **Cancel** to exit the tool

Terminal output confirms each account unlocked, showing both display name and SamAccountName.
